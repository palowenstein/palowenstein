The ATARI 600XL, the classic computer I grew up with and learned coding on. I quickly pushed it to 64Ko with an upgrade (ATARI 1064) before moving on to a 128Ko model (ATARI 130XE) later on. The classic ATARI 8-bit architecture was designed by luminaries such as Jay Miner, Joe Decuir, George McLeod, Douglas Neubauer (father of the A8 Killer App STAR RAIDERS), François Michel, Steve Smith, etc. Most of them would later design the AMIGA creating three generations of classic machines: The ATARI VCS, The ATARI 400/800 (8-bit line) and the AMIGA 1000.
